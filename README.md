# vnewman
A small program for me to toy with the idea of self-replicating machines (Von Newmann machines).

# Install and run
Make sure you have rust (programming language) and cargo installed.
Navigate to the project directory:
  cd /home/<your_user>/<your_projects_dir_path>/vnewmann

Run the custom script to execute the program a set number of times:
  ./run_x_times.sh
If the script isn't executable, make it:
  chmod u+x run_x_times.sh (or use a+x for all users)

Alternatively, you can run the command just once using:
  cargo run
